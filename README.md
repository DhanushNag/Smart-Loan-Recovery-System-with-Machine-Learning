# 💸 Smart Loan Recovery System with Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview

Loan defaults significantly affect the profitability and liquidity of financial institutions. This project builds a **Smart Loan Recovery System** using machine learning to predict default risk, optimize collection strategies, and improve overall loan repayment performance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict the likelihood of loan default using historical data
- Segment borrowers based on risk levels and repayment behavior
- Recommend optimized recovery strategies to reduce cost and effort

## 📦 Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loan amount, income, payment history, etc.

2. **Model Training**
   - Binary classification: Default vs No Default
   - Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC

3. **Risk Segmentation**
   - Categorize borrowers into low, medium, and high risk groups.
   - Enables targeted recovery strategies.

4. **Optimization Insights**
   - Identify factors contributing to defaults (e.g., income, credit history).
   - Suggest customized collection actions (e.g., early reminders, restructuring).

## 📊 Sample Outputs

- Confusion Matrix and ROC curve for model performance
- Feature importance ranking (e.g., loan amount, employment type)
- Risk group distribution visualization
